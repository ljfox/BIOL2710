# Foundations of Biology 3 Data Analyses 

Hello FB3 Students! Here you will find all the tutorials you will need to complete the three data analyses assignments. 

### In BIOL 2710 Foundations of Biology III you will perform several data analysis (DA) exercises to develop skills in: 

* Selecting the appropriate type of graph for a particulat data set (line graph, scatter plot or bar graph)
* Using a spreadsheet program (Excel) to enter data and calculate summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, and standard error)
* Constructign graphs using Excel with the appropriate axis titles and lables
* Using Basic statistics to test hypothesis (t-test, ANOVA, and linear regression)
* Writing figure captions that are informative yet concise
* Interpreting data in graphs

### How to approach the DAs: 
The DAs will contain data from a variety of investigations. To make sense of each of these investigations ask yourself the following questions: 
* Why did they do it?
  * This will be in the introductory material to the specific DA
* How did they do it?
  * Also in each handout, and you should summarize this in the figure caption
* What were the results? 
  * Determine the proper graph type and construct the graph
  * After you have constructed the graph you can more easily describe any trends in the data
* What do the results mean? 
  * Address this in your discussion paragraph
